This weeks homework is a BIG group exercise. 

Please submit your homeworks (one per team) going forward via this form (and not thru the ISVC):

https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1ZOr9RnIe_A06AcZDB6K1mJN4vrLeSmS2PD6Xm3eOiis/viewform?usp=send_form

HW13 will need a cluster of computers. Please divide and conquer the workload!


====================================================
===HW 13.1: Spark implementation of basic PageRank===

Write a basic Spark implementation of the iterative PageRank algorithm
that takes sparse adjacency lists as input.
Make sure that your implementation utilizes teleportation (1-damping/the number of nodes in the network), 
and further, distributes the mass of dangling nodes with each iteration
so that the output of each iteration is correctly normalized (sums to 1).
[NOTE: The PageRank algorithm assumes that a random surfer (walker), starting from a random web page,
chooses the next page to which it will move by clicking at random, with probability d,
one of the hyperlinks in the current page. This probability is represented by a so-called
‘damping factor’ d, where d ∈ (0, 1). Otherwise, with probability (1 − d), the surfer
jumps to any web page in the network. If a page is a dangling end, meaning it has no
outgoing hyperlinks, the random surfer selects an arbitrary web page from a uniform
distribution and “teleports” to that page]

In your Spark solution, please use broadcast variables and caching to make sure your code is as efficient as possible.


As you build your code, use the test data

s3://ucb-mids-mls-networks/PageRank-test.txt
Or under the Data Subfolder for HW7 on Dropbox with the same file name. 
(On Dropbox https://www.dropbox.com/sh/2c0k5adwz36lkcw/AAAAKsjQfF9uHfv-X9mCqr9wa?dl=0)

with teleportation parameter set to 0.15 (1-d, where d, the damping factor is set to 0.85), and crosscheck
your work with the true result, displayed in the first image
in the Wikipedia article:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank

and here for reference are the corresponding PageRank probabilities:

A,0.033
B,0.384
C,0.343
D,0.039
E,0.081
F,0.039
G,0.016
H,0.016
I,0.016
J,0.016
K,0.016

Run this experiment locally first. Report the local configuration that you used and how long in minutes and seconds it takes to complete your job.

Repeat this experiment on AWS. Report the AWS cluster configuration that you used and how long in minutes and seconds it takes to complete your job. (in your notebook, cat the cluster config file)


===================================================================
===HW 13.2: Applying PageRank to the Wikipedia hyperlinks network===

Run your Spark PageRank implementation on the Wikipedia dataset for 10 iterations,
and display the top 100 ranked nodes (with alpha = 0.85).

Run your PageRank implementation on the Wikipedia dataset for 50 iterations,
and display the top 100 ranked nodes (with teleportation factor of 0.15). 
Plot the pagerank values for the top 100 pages resulting from the 50 iterations run. Then plot the pagerank values for the same 100 pages that resulted from the 10 iterations run.  Comment on your findings.  Have the top 100 ranked pages changed? Have the pagerank values changed? Explain.

Report the AWS cluster configuration that you used and how long in minutes and seconds it takes to complete your job.

NOTE: ====  English Wikipedia hyperlink network.data ====
The dataset is available via Dropbox at:

https://www.dropbox.com/sh/2c0k5adwz36lkcw/AAAAKsjQfF9uHfv-X9mCqr9wa?dl=0

on S3 at  s3://ucb-mids-mls-networks/wikipedia/
-- s3://ucb-mids-mls-networks/wikipedia/all-pages-indexed-out.txt # Graph
-- s3://ucb-mids-mls-networks/wikipedia/indices.txt               # Page titles and page Ids

The dataset is built from the Sept. 2015 XML snapshot of English Wikipedia.
For this directed network, a link between articles: 

A -> B

is defined by the existence of a hyperlink in A pointing to B.
This network also exists in the indexed format:

Data: s3://ucb-mids-mls-networks/wikipedia/all-pages-indexed-out.txt
Data: s3://ucb-mids-mls-networks/wikipedia/all-pages-indexed-in.txt
Data: s3://ucb-mids-mls-networks/wikipedia/indices.txt

but has an index with more detailed data:

(article name) \t (index) \t (in degree) \t (out degree)

In the dictionary, target nodes are keys, link weights are values .
Here, a weight indicates the number of time a page links to another.
However, for the sake of this assignment, treat this an unweighted network,
and set all weights to 1 upon data input.


===================================================================
===HW 13.3: Spark GraphX versus your implementation of PageRank ===

Run the Spark  GraphX PageRank implementation on the Wikipedia dataset for 10 iterations,
and display the top 100 ranked nodes (with alpha = 0.85).

Run your PageRank implementation on the Wikipedia dataset for 50 iterations,
and display the top 100 ranked nodes (with teleportation factor of 0.15). 
Have the top 100 ranked pages changed? Comment on your findings. Plot both 100 curves.

Report the AWS cluster configuration that you used and how long in minutes and seconds it takes to complete this job.

Put the runtime results of HW13.2 and HW13.3 in a tabular format (with rows corresponding to implemention and columns corresponding to experiment setup (10 iterations, 50 iterations)). Discuss the run times and explaing the differences. 

Plot the pagerank values for the top 100 pages resulting from the 50 iterations run (using GraphX). Then plot the pagerank values for the same 100 pages that resulted from the 50 iterations run of your homegrown pagerank implemnentation.  Comment on your findings.  Have the top 100 ranked pages changed? Have the pagerank values changed? Explain.
